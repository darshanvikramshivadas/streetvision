# Road Pothole and Street Light Detection Using OpenCV and YOLOv8

## Project Overview

This project implements a **Road Pothole and Street Light Detection** model using **OpenCV** and **YOLOv8**, leveraging state-of-the-art computer vision techniques for accurate detection. Additionally, the project features **depth and dimension calculations** for potholes based on focal length and other relevant parameters, which helps estimate potential accelerometer values for understanding road conditions.

### Key Features:
- **Pothole Detection**: Detects road potholes with high accuracy using YOLOv8.
- **Street Light Detection**: Identifies street lights in real-time video feeds or images.
- **Depth & Dimension Calculation**: Calculates the depth and dimensions of detected potholes.
- **Accelerometer Estimation**: Estimates the possible impact on vehicles using calculated parameters.

## Running the Model

To run the detection model on an image or video, simply execute the following command:

```bash
python test.py
```
